# embeddedSysThermostat
I created a thermostat program using C language and a TI C3220 embedded system. A timer executed tasks at different intervals to keep data updated and react accordingly. The program is designed to be an thermostat with an automatic temperature adjuster. The system checks for user input on increasing and decreasing the temparature through buttons. The room temperature is surveyed and recorded using a in-built temperature reader. 
The program required the usage of UART, GPIO, Timers, and I2C peripherals.
